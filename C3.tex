\begin{problem}
Let \(K\) be a number field of degree \(n\) over \(\QQ\). Prove that every nonzero ideal \(I\) in \(R = \AA \cap K\) is a free abelian group of rank \(n\).
\end{problem}
We can choose a basis of \(R\) and so, we represent \(\alpha\) as \(c_1b_1+c_2b_2+ \dots\). The product, \(\alpha R\) is going to be \(c_1b_1R+c_2b_2R+\dots\). For each \(c_ib_iR\), we know that \(b_i\) is going to permute the basis and a multiple of it, and \(c_i\) acts obviously on it. So in general, we're going to have \(\alpha R = (k_{11}\ZZ,k_{12}\ZZ,\dots) + (k_{21}\ZZ,k_{22}\ZZ)\dots\). However, we have that \(a\ZZ+b\ZZ = \gcd(a,b)\ZZ \cong \ZZ\), so we have that \(\alpha R\) is going to be a rank \(n)\) free abelian group provided that \(\alpha\) is nonzero, and \(R\) is also a rank \(n\) free abelian group. Finally, observe that \(\alpha R \subset I \subset R\) whenever \(\alpha \in I\), which gives us the result.
